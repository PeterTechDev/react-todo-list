# React To-Do List App 📝

A responsive and dynamic **To-Do List** application built with **React** and **TypeScript**, designed to help users manage their daily tasks. The app supports adding, completing, and deleting tasks, with task persistence using **Local Storage** to ensure data is saved across browser sessions.

## 🚀 [Live Demo](https://petertechdev.github.io/react-todo-list/)

## 📜 Key Features

- Add tasks with real-time validation (e.g., task length, forbidden words).
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with a simple toggle.
- Delete tasks easily using a one-click action.
- Tasks are persisted in **Local Storage** for session-to-session retention.
- Mobile-first design with responsive layout using **CSS Flexbox**.
- Accessible UI with clear feedback and animations for user interactions.

## 💼 Skills & Technologies

- **React** with **TypeScript** for robust component structure and type safety.
- **CSS Modules** for scoped, maintainable styles.
- **Local Storage** API for persistent task data.
- **useState**, **useEffect** hooks for efficient state and lifecycle management.
- Form handling and validation with user-friendly feedback (input error handling, animations).
- Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration.
